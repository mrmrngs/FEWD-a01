# Miri Readme
I guess I'd call myself a lifelong student -- I love learning and I love doing research. I have a bit of what I'd call an encyclopedia brain, where I'm really good at memorizing the details of something I'm interested in, but unfortunately my encyclopedia only has very limited pages, so when I move on from one interest to the next, I forget what I knew about the last interest. I'm very good at random trivia though! I suppose my top achievements in life are the trips I took to climb Mt Kilimanjaro and visit Everest base camp while I was in college. Over the last couple years, I got very involved in growing houseplants, and now have a semi-thriving orchid and carnivorous plant collection (in addition to the 40-50 other plants in my tiny apartment). My favorite carnivorous plant genus is [pinguicula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinguicula).

## Goin' Adventuring
As soon as FEWD II ends in June, I am actually moving abroad to Australia for a year! This trip was originally supposed to happen in 2020, and I was supposed to stay for three years, but for obvious reasons, I was unable to go. When Australia reopened their borders last year, I applied, and was accepted (albeit on a more limited time period). I've wanted to visit Australia my entire life, so I am incredibly excited to finally be able to see some of the incredible biodiversity up close and personal.

My top trip bucket list items:

* Snorkel the Great Barrier Reef
* See Uluru
* Visit the Daintree Rainforest
* Drive the Great Ocean Road
* Glow worm caves!!

Here is an orchid that I grew briefly last year:
